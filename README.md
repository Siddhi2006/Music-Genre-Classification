# Music Genre Classification
This project uses Machine Learning techniques to classify music into different genres based on audio features extracted from the sound files. It demonstrates a practical use of signal processing and ML for audio analysis.

# Project Overview
- **Goal**: Predict the genre of a music file using features like MFCCs, Chroma, and Spectral Contrast.
- **Dataset**: [GTZAN Music Genre Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification)
- **Genres Included**: Classical, Pop, Rock, Jazz, Hip-Hop, Blues, etc.

# Technologies Used
- Python
- Librosa (for audio feature extraction)
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

# Features Extracted
- MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)
- Chroma Frequencies
- Spectral Centroid
- Zero Crossing Rate
- Spectral Roll-off
